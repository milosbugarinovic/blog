# [DRAFT] MSH - Micro-Service Helper

As a developer, I often found myself needing to create custom solutions for common problems in my work with microservices. I wanted a collection of lightweight, easy-to-use tools that could assist me in building and managing microservices without relying on large, complex frameworks. This is what inspired me to create `msh` (micro-service helper), an open source project that provides just that.

## Idea

> The idea behind MSH is a set of tools that mimics a micro-framework in a decoupled manner, allowing developers to use only the tools they need without being dependent on a monolithic framework. I wrote msh to be used in Typescript/Node.js projects, but it can also be used in web projects.


One of the key features of `msh` is its flexibility. Since its initial release, I have continued to develop and add new tools to `msh`. I also welcome contributions from other developers who want to shared their own ideas and tools to make `msh` even more useful. Although the project is still young, I am excited to see how it will grow and evolve in the future. I designed `msh` to be modular, so developers can easily add or remove tools as needed. This flexibility makes `msh` ideal for use in a wide range of projects, from small personal projects to large enterprise applications.

In creating `msh`, I was inspired by the `SOLID` principles of software development. I wanted to create a project that was well-organized, easy to maintain, and adaptable to changing needs. By following these principles, I believe that `msh` provides a solid foundation for microservices development that can help developers save time and improve the quality of their work.

In the following sections, I will go into more detail on the specific features and benefits of `msh`, and explain how it can help developers work more efficiently and effectively with microservices.
