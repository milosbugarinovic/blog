# msh-util

`msh-util` is a part of a larger collection of useful tools
which I personally use in all my professional and personal projects

This library is a collection of useful functionalities that can be used across multiple projects (frontend, backend and mobile if all projects are writer in typescript)

Util is a bit generic name and it all makes sense when you take a look at the functionalities that it provides. Actual it is a collection of various functionalities that are to small to be exported in a separate library. If at any time some similar functionality get a bit lager we will extract them into separate library.
